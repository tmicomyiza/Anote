Summary: A note taking App that helps organize notes efficiently

Inspiration: Sometimes I use my phone to take notes, but as a visual learner I find it hard to keep a connection 
between written notes and visual content since I store them in two different places. Therefore, I challenged myself 
find a solution to resolve this uncomfortable situation.

Solution: Anote "Advanced Note"
I'm developing an iOS App that will allow user to save images at the same place he/she writes notes.
